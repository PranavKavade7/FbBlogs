                <p>Hello, I am a worker at FriendsBook sharing my perspective with you all, including my college friends. I’m also an undergrad like many of you!</p>
                <p>I consider myself a nerd but can play any role in life when justified!</p>
                <p>Currently, I’m studying at MIT, so we will have many friendly and interesting conversations. Let’s stay connected!</p>

                <h2>Social Life in College</h2>

                <p>For understanding the situation of others, I’m building a platform for college students and people to share their college experiences.</p>
                <p>Most students enjoy both study and fun; some, like me, focus on just study.</p>
                <p>People can share from any perspective.</p>
